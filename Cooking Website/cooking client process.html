	<h3>Nancy's Website</h3>
	
	<h3>Client Needs</h3>
	<p>Nancy would like a very simple and easy website to navigate. She definitely likes pictures. Basically, she would like to have a site to compile and collect all the recipes that she has and wants to have. I'm also going to include videos for tutorials. Visually I will keep the text large and work with a pastel palette to go easy on her eyesight. I want to include a search box because those are very helpful. The layout of the site will be designed with the potential of adding more content, like a library. I will also try to include comparative sites (for prices of the ingredients and such). While links are a lovely feature, I don't want the site to be confusing so I will try to keep that to a minimum as well.
	</p>
	<p>A unique factor of her website would be translating measurements from chinese recipes, because she likes to cook a lot of chinese dishes/desserts. An important thing to keep in mind is the translation. She also needs to convert measurements, because we use a completely different measuring system here. This would help make the cooking/baking process a lot easier. Nancy would also like to be able to send or share these recipes with other people like her friends. Simple, clean and functional seem to the key words here.
