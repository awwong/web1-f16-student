	<h1>Cooking Website Process Page</h1>
	<h3>Nancy's Website</h3>
	
	<h3>Client Needs</h3>
	<p>Nancy would like a very simple and easy website to navigate. She definitely likes pictures. Basically, she would like to have a site to compile and collect all the recipes that she has and wants to have. 
	</p>
	<p>A unique factor of her website would be translating measurements from chinese recipes, because she likes to cook a lot of chinese dishes/desserts. An important thing to keep in mind is the translation. Nancy would also like to be able to send or share these recipes with other people like her friends. Simple, clean and functional seem to the key words here.
