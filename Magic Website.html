		<h1>Shin Lim</h1>
<img src="https://www.magicconvention.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/headlinerphoto-1.jpg" />
		<h5>Reigning FISM World Champion in Close up Card Magic</h5>	 
		<p>
He ‘Fooled’ Penn and Teller, and he’s performed on Broadway with The Illusionists. In 2015 he became the FISM World Championship of Closeup Card Magic and now he’s coming to New Zealand!

Coming to us all the way from Boston, Massachusetts, Shin originally went to university to study piano performance. However he was forced to drop out due to developing carpal tunnel syndrome, picking up magic instead. In less than a decade Shin Lim has become one of the most in demand magicians in the world.

His act on Penn and Teller: Fool Us has been seen by over 20 million people online, and now he is bringing his act to New Zealand. Shin will be presenting a lecture during the convention, and performing in the Saturday Gala Show.

			 	<h1> Rob Zabrecky</h1>

		<h5> Two-time ‘Stage Magician of the Year’ – Magic Castle</h5>	 
		<p>
As a magician, there is simply no one like him. He invents a magical world through a series of strange and beautiful effects, which he combines with remarkable timing and theatrical edifice. Zabrecky sets the stage for everyday life, then sets is on fire. As a magic humorist, he creates a dryly abstracted, austere universe that pushes magic to its very edges and often explores bizarre and contemplative human behavior.

MAGIC Magazine described him as, “A unique persona, highly reminiscent of Norman Bates, with a bit of Rod Serling in the mix — a psycho from the Twilight Zone, doing magic.”

In 2011 and 2012 he was voted “Stage Magician of the Year” by the Academy of Magical Arts at the Magic Castle, and in 2014, voted “Parlour Magician of the Year” by the same organization.</p>
			 	<h1>Hector Mancha</h1>
<img src="https://www.magicconvention.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/headlinerphoto-3.jpg" />

		<h5>Reigning FISM Grand Prix World Champion of Magic</h5>	 
		<p>
Hector is a multi-disciplinary artist coming to us all the way from Madrid, Spain. He specialises in card magic, parlour magic, pickpocketing, manipulation, hands shadows and improvisation.

In 2015, Hector won the highest honour in Magic… the FISM World Grand Prix, also being crowned as the World Champion of Manipulation at the same event.

Hector will be lecturing at the convention and will be performing his world champion manipulation act at the Saturday Gala Show! </p>
<h5>Fourth headliner to be announced soon…</h5>
