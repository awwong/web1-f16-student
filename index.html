    I am taking the class to learn how to design websites, interactive designs and coding. Cuz coding seems cool. I really don't know much at all though...but I'm hoping to learn lots! I'm super confused most of the time. Don't mind teaching me like a 10 year old, I need you to dumb it down for me.
